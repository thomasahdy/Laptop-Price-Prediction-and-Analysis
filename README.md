# Laptop-Price-Prediction-and-Analysis


## Overview

This project delivers an interactive dashboard and machine learning pipeline for analyzing and predicting laptop prices based on features like brand, processor, RAM, GPU, screen size, resolution, and more.

Acknowledgments
Inspired by real-world laptop price datasets and market analysis.

Utilizes open-source Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.

## Usage

1. Run the notebook to load and preview the dataset.
2. Visualize distributions and summary statistics.
3. Use the dashboard to analyze price trends by feature.
4. Train regression models and predict laptop prices.

## Features

- Interactive dashboard for price analysis
- Data exploration and visualization
- Machine learning regression models
- Custom filters for processor, GPU, and RAM
